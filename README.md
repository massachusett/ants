# About the Repo
This repository contains my final project (in collaboration with Henry Cerbone '23) for MATH 242: Mathematical Biology-Evolutionary Dynamics. This course was taken during my time as undergraduate student at Harvard during the Fall '22 semester. The project centers around modeling the one-to-two year life expectancy of red harvester ant colonies based on neighborhoods.
